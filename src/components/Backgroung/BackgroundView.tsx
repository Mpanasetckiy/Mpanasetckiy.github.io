          Embarked on my IT journey in 2021, joining{" "}
          <a href="https://www.dunice.net/"> Dunice </a> as an Associate
          Software Developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Driven by a passion for software development, I relocated to London
          and enrolled at <a href="https://newham.ac.uk/"> Newham College</a>.
          Graduating in 2023, I seized the opportunity to broaden my skills by
          joining <a href="https://codeyourfuture.io/"> CodeYourFuture </a> as a
          Full-Stack Software Developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eager to push my limits, I joined
          <a href="https://northcoders.com/"> Northcoders</a>. During an
          intensive three-month program, I rapidly deepen my knowledge and
          collaborated with talented people and created two impressive projects.

          One of the major things I liked about being a Software Engineer is
          solidifying the connection between engineering and the graphic end of
          the spectrum, yet being able to work with incredible people.

          When I'm not in front of a computer, I am probably traveling, tearing
          up the pavement on my penny board or crossing another item off my
          bucket list.
